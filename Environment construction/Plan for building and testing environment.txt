1. ASV path following
1.1. Build a 2D environment that plot the Boustrophedon coverage path
1.2. Simulate the ASV following the path (with speed and heading angle)

2. Obstacles simulation
2.1. Generate static obstacles
2.2. Generate dynamic obstacles with constant velocity

3. Simulate the LiDAR sensor
3.1. Combine part 1 and 2 to show the ASV following the Boustrophedon path with obstacles on the map
3.2. Draw a circle aroud the ASV to simulate the Lidar sensor detecting obstacles as the ASV approaches
